## Q&A

### Why did I build this application?

My primary motivation for this project was to explore and experiment with the **Supabase client** and build a **backend-less application**. Having always developed my own backend systems, I wanted to experience the ease and speed of a service like Supabase.

### Why Three.js?

Since Supabase offers a remarkably quick setup (literally "1-minute setup"), I decided to introduce an additional challenge and learning opportunity by integrating **Three.js**. This allowed me to delve into 3D graphics development and enhance the application's visual appeal.

### Why EventTarget (custom global event system)?

I prioritize **easy navigation** in web applications. I dislike the need to constantly move the mouse across the screen to click on elements. Therefore, I decided that all my future applications would incorporate **keyboard shortcuts** to facilitate interaction and improve the overall user experience.

### What is the concept of this app?

This application is designed for **anonymous, positive communication**. It's a simple platform where users can share kind words or messages with others, either directly or indirectly. The core idea is to create a space where people can anonymously spread happiness and good vibes.
